### Hi, I’m Florian 👋

I’m a full-stack developer working on the future of EV charging.  
These days I’m mostly in **.NET** and **Azure**, building reliable backend systems and developer tooling.

## What I do

- Building backend services for EV charging and payments
- Shipping cloud-native workloads on Azure (Functions, containers, queues, observability)
- Writing tooling that makes dev workflows smoother (especially around Neovim)

## Tech I reach for a lot

**Backend:** C#, .NET, Azure Functions, distributed messaging  
**Cloud:** Azure (App Insights, Key Vault, CI/CD, containers)  
**Data:** SQL + “whatever fits” (I care more about correctness than fashion)  
**Editor:** Neovim (yes, really)

## Open source

- **azfunc.nvim** — debug Azure Functions in Neovim with DAP integration  
  (If you’re using .NET isolated Functions and you’re tired of clunky debugging setups, this is for you.)

- **zmk-config** — my keyboard config / experiments

## Fun facts (the non-cringe version)

- I like building things that are boring in production (reliable, observable, predictable).
- I’m into keyboards and the “make my editor do more” rabbit hole.
